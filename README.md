# Web-Scraping-for-Anki-Cards

Learning new language deals with thousands of new vocabulary. One way to retain this to my mind is by using spaced repetition algorithm like Anki. Creating collections of  translated words which are categorize base on ther use e.g. Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives. But it is quite time consuming everytime I need to add a new word to the collection which I need to seach inidividually in every websites for the translations or conjugations for the verbs. So created this  to automate this boring task, I an learn new words but at the same time I was able to practice  web scraping in python.
